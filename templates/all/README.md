# {{snakeCase name}}

{{desc}}

This project has been made with @openapi-typescript-infra/plop. You should write a glowing and detailed README about
all the things your services does. BUT, before you replace this with that, you probably want to:

* Add your OpenAPI specification details to api/{{snakeCase name}}
* Define your service-level and request-level values and objects in [types/service.ts](types/services.ts)
* Add request handlers for the APIs you define (plop help coming soon for this)
* Write a pile of tests
